Hi there, my name is Malte Prieß and I am an enthusiastic professor and scientist in the field of cloud technologies, programming, software engineering and KI/ML, data science, working as a [professor for cloud technologies and applied computer science](https://www.fh-kiel.de/fachbereiche/informatik-und-elektrotechnik/wir-ueber-uns/lehre/professuren-und-lehrkraefte-fuer-besondere-aufgaben-lfba/priess-prof-dr-malte/) at the [FH Kiel, University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fh-kiel.de/en/home/), [Faculty of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering](https://www.fh-kiel.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-computer-science-and-electrical-engineering/).

I am a highly commited person love working at the cutting edge together with clever people.

Before taking over the professorship for cloud technologies at FH Kiel on October 1, 2024, I was dean and professor of applied computer science at the [DHSH University of Applied Sciences](https://www.dhsh.de) for eight years. I gained extensive experience in research and teaching as well as in business. After studying computer engineering and physics at the [Berliner Hochschule für Technik](https://www.bht-berlin.de/en/) and [Leibniz University Hanover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/), I completed my doctorate in the junior research group [Algorithmic Optimal Control](https://www.algopt.informatik.uni-kiel.de/en) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.inf.uni-kiel.de/en) at [Kiel University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/de/).

In my professional career, I have worked as a research assistant at [Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel (GEOMAR)](https://www.geomar.de/en/) and at the [Engineering Optimization & Modeling Center](http://eomc.ru.is/eoml_index.html) at [Reykjavik University](https://en.ru.is) as well as an IT developer and consultant at [d-fine GmbH](https://www.d-fine.com/en/) in various national and international projects. My research adresses the interface of cloud computing, artificial intelligence and modern software engineering. The focus is on innovative approaches to scaling, automation and optimisation of complex systems.

I am excited about the opportunity to drive innovative projects and research projects at Kiel UAS and to inspire students for current technological topics. I see my new position as an opportunity to make optimal use of my extensive expertise in teaching and research and to further expand it in the great environment at Kiel UAS.

<!-- Before my current employment, I was able to implement and develop my technical orientation at [d-fine GmbH](http://d-fine.com), a European consulting firm with a focus on analytically challenging topics. There, I was involved in various software projects with a data science background for different - both national and international - companies. For example, I developed algorithms for data processing and model-based evaluation procedures. This included, for example, the development of a tool for capital planning, a web-based tool for calculating the regulatory solvency capital requirements according to Solvency II, the replacement of an existing CVA calculation approach based on Monte Carlo simulation and the development of a tool for the valuation of commodity derivatives. Most recently, I developed a capital planning tool for a large Italian insurance group.

As dean (and former head of department) I have been successfully leading the department of Business Informatics at the [Duale Hochschule Schleswig-Holstein (DHSH)](https://www.dhsh.de) for eight years. I played a key role in the successful transformation of the former university of cooperative education into the new DHSH. -->

Apart from work, I am crazy for many kinds of sports, climbing, hiking, mountain biking, kitesurfing, snowboarding and skiing (especially touring ski) and finally wing and pump foiling. I started the latter in 2018 and this is, among being in the mountains, my absolute favorite sport. Its fast, challenging, feels like flying and you can go out at and explore so many different places not possible using usual surfing setups. I am father of two lovely and crazy little boys.
