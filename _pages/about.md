Hi there, my name is Malte Prie√ü and I am an enthusiastic data scientists and lecturer in the field of programming, KI/ML, data science, mathematics and software engineering, currently working as a <a href="https://www.dhsh.de/professorenschaft-und-leitung/" target="_blank">professor and dean for Business Informatics</a> in Kiel, at the Duale Hochschule Schleswig-Holstein ([DHSH](https://www.dhsh.de)).  I am a highly commited person love working at the cutting edge together with clever people.

Before my current employment, I was able to implement and develop my technical orientation at <a href="http://d-fine.com" target="_blank">d-fine GmbH</a>, a European consulting firm with a focus on analytically challenging topics. There, I was involved in various software projects with a data science background for different - both national and international - companies. For example, I developed algorithms for data processing and model-based evaluation procedures. This included, for example, the development of a tool for capital planning, a web-based tool for calculating the regulatory solvency capital requirements according to Solvency II, the replacement of an existing CVA calculation approach based on Monte Carlo simulation and the development of a tool for the valuation of commodity derivatives. Most recently, I developed a capital planning tool for a large Italian insurance group.

As dean (and former head of department) I have been successfully leading the department of Business Informatics at the <a href="https://www.dhsh.de" target="_blank">Duale Hochschule Schleswig-Holstein (DHSH)</a> for over four years now. I played a key role in the successful transformation of the former university of cooperative education into the new DHSH. 

Apart from work, I am crazy for many kinds of sports, climbing, hiking, mountain biking, kitesurfing, snowboarding and skiing (especially touring ski) and finally kite foiling. I started the latter in 2018 and this is, among being in the mountains, my absolute favorite sport. Its fast, challenging, feels like flying and you can go out at and explore so many different places not possible using usual surfing setups. I am father of two lovely and crazy little sons and happily married.
