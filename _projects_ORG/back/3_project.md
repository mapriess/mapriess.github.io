This project explores **multi-cloud strategies** for modern enterprises seeking to 
improve agility and resilience while reducing **vendor lock-in**. Specifically, it 
focuses on the challenges and opportunities of integrating workloads across **AWS** 
and **Alibaba Cloud**, addressing critical **interoperability** and migration issues.

The project provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of **AWS** and 
**Alibaba Cloud**, examining architectural, service, and policy differences that 
affect workload migration between these major cloud providers. This analysis is 
particularly relevant for organizations pursuing global cloud strategies.

Through an exploratory case study, the project investigates the migration of 
**IoT workloads** using both provider-native and open source 
**Infrastructure-as-Code** tools. This hands-on approach reveals practical insights 
into the technical complexities of cross-cloud deployments.

The project delivers key findings on technical trade-offs and establishes best 
practices for secure multi-cloud deployments. The results provide actionable 
guidance for organizations seeking to leverage the synergy between **AWS** and 
**Alibaba Cloud**, enabling them to make informed decisions about their global 
multi-cloud infrastructure strategies.
