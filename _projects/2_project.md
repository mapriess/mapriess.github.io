This project addresses the emerging **security challenges posed by offensive AI** - 
the use of AI-based software to attack non-AI assets. With AI capabilities such as 
high automation and complex pattern recognition becoming widely available, the 
potential for exploitation significantly increases.

While current research explores offensive AI utilization and classification, and 
threat modeling methods are being developed for AI-based assets, critical gaps 
remain. Organizations need effective ways to quantify the factors contributing to 
AI threats and to assess the risk of AI-based attacks across all their assets. 
This challenge is particularly acute in cloud environments with their sophisticated 
infrastructure and complex access control landscapes.

To address these challenges, this project developed the **Graph of Effort**, an 
intuitive, flexible, and effective **threat modeling method**. The Graph of Effort 
quantifies the effort required by an adversary to use offensive AI for vulnerability 
exploitation, enabling security analysts to rank vulnerabilities and prioritize 
proactive countermeasures.

The project delivers a functional threat model that provides valuable support for 
vulnerability assessment. It enables organizations to systematically analyze how 
offensive AI could be leveraged against their assets and helps security teams make 
informed decisions about defense strategies. Future work will focus on empirical 
validation of the design choices underlying the threat model.
