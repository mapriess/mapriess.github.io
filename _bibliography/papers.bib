Then we describe two optimization approaches, the One-shot and the Surrogate-based Optimization method. Both methods aim to reduce the high computational effort caused by the slow state iteration. The idea of the One-shot approach is to construct a combined iteration for state, adjoint and parameters, thus avoiding expensive forward and reverse computations of a standard adjoint method. In the Surrogate-based Optimization method, the original model is replaced by a surrogate which is here based on a truncated iteration with fewer steps. We compare both approaches, provide implementation details for the presented application, and give some numerical results.},

The application on real (measurement) data is covered in this paper. Essential here are a special model data treatment and further methodological enhancements which allow us to improve the robustness of the algorithm and the accuracy of the solution.

  abstract = {We present the application of the Surrogate-based Optimization (SBO) method on a parameter identification problem for a 3-D biogeochemical model. SBO is a method for acceleration of optimization processes when the underlying model itself is of very high computational complexity. In these cases, coupled simulation runs require large amounts of computer time, where optimization runs may become unfeasible even with high-performance hardware. As a consequence, the key idea of SBO is to replace the original and computationally expensive (high-fidelity) model by a so-called surrogate, which is created from a less accurate but computationally cheaper (low-fidelity) model and a suitable correction approach to increase its accuracy. To date, the SBO approach has been widely and successfully used in engineering applications and also for parameter identification in a 1-D marine ecosystem model of NPZD type. In this paper, we apply the approach onto a two-component biogeochemical model. The model is spun-up into a steady seasonal cycle via the Transport Matrix Approach. The low-fidelity model we use consists of a reduced number of spin-up iterations (several decades instead of millennia used for the original model). A multiplicative correction operator is further exploited to extrapolate the rather inaccurate low-fidelity model onto the original one. This corrected model builds our surrogate. We validate this SBO method by twin-experiments that use synthetic observations generated by the original model. We motivate our choice of the low-fidelity model and the multiplicative correction and discuss the computational advantage of SBO in comparison to an expensive parameter optimization in the context of the high-fidelity model. The proposed SBO technique is shown to yield a solution close to the target at a significant gain of computational efficiency. Without further regularization techniques, the method is able to identify most model parameters. The method is simple to implement and presents a promising and pragmatic tool to calibrate biogeochemical models in a global three-dimensional setting.},

The model, developed by Oschlies and Garcon [1], simulates the distribution of nitrogen, phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus in a water column and is driven by ocean circulation data. A key issue is to minimize the misfit between the model output and given observational data. Our aim is to reduce the overall optimization cost avoiding expensive function and derivative evaluations by using a surrogate model replacing the high-fidelity model in focus. This in particular becomes important for more complex three-dimensional models. We analyse a coarsening in the discretization of the model equations as one way to create such a surrogate. Here the numerical stability crucially depends upon the discrete stepsize in time and space and the biochemical terms. We show that for given model parameters the level of grid coarsening can be choosen accordingly yielding a stable and satisfactory surrogate. As one example of a surrogate-based optimization method we present results of the Aggressive Space Mapping technique (developed by John W. Bandler [2, 3]) applied to the optimization of this one-dimensional biogeochemical transport model.},

An improved surrogate-based optimization methodology, which addresses these issues, is developed for the optimization of a representative of the class of one-dimensional marine ecosystem models. Our technique is based upon a multiplicative response correction technique to create a computationally cheap but yet reasonably accurate surrogate from a temporarily coarser discretized physics-based coarse model. The original version of this methodology was capable of yielding about 84{\%} computational cost savings when compared to the fine ecosystem model optimization. Here, we demonstrate that by employing relatively simple modifications, the surrogate model accuracy and the efficiency of the optimization process can be further improved. More specifically, for the considered test case, the optimization cost is reduced three times, i.e., from about 15{\%} to only 5{\%} of the cost of the direct fine model optimization.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystem models are of great importance for understanding the oceanic uptake of carbon dioxide and for projections of the marine ecosystem’s responses to climate change. The applicability of a marine ecosystem model for prognostic simulations crucially depends on its ability to resemble the actually observed physical and biogeochemical processes. An assessment of the quality of a given model is typically based on its calibration against observed quantities. This calibration or optimization process is intrinsically linked to an adjustment of typically poorly known model parameters. Straightforward calibration attempts by direct adjustment of the model parameters using conventional optimization algorithms are often tedious or even beyond the capabilities of modern computer power as they normally require a large number of simulations. This typically results in prohibitively high computational cost, particularly if already a single model evaluation involves time-consuming computer simulations. The optimization of coupled hydrodynamical marine ecosystem models simulating biogeochemical processes in the ocean is here a representative example. Computing times of hours up to several days already for a single model evaluation are not uncommon. A computationally efficient optimization of expensive simulation models can be realized using for example surrogate-based optimization. Therein, the optimization of the expensive, so-called high-fidelity (or fine) model is carried out by means of a surrogate – a fine model’s fast but yet reasonably accurate representation. This work comprises an investigation and application of surrogate-based optimization methodologies employing physics-based low-fidelity (or coarse) models. Seeking a computationally efficient calibration of marine ecosystem models serves as the fundamental aim. As a case study, two illustrative marine ecosystem models are considered. Here, coarse models obtained by a coarser temporal resolution and by a truncated model spin-up are investigated. The accuracy of these computationally cheaper coarse models is typically not sufficient to directly exploit them in the optimization loop in lieu of the fine model. I investigate suitable correction techniques to ensure that the corrected coarse model (the surrogate) provides a reliable prediction of the fine model optimum. Firstly, I focus on Aggressive Space Mapping as one of the original Space Mapping approaches. It will be shown that this optimization method allows to achieve a reasonable reduction in the optimization costs, provided that the considered coarse and fine model are sufficiently “similar”. A multiplicative response correction approach, subsequently investigated, turned out to be very suitable for the considered marine ecosystem models. A reliable surrogate can be obtained. Exploiting the latter in a surrogate-based optimization algorithm, a computationally cheap but yet accurate solution is achieved. The optimization costs can be significantly reduced compared to what is achieved by the Aggressive Space Mapping algorithm. The proposed methodologies, particularly the multiplicative response correction approach, serve as initial parts of a set of tools for a computationally efficient calibration of marine ecosystem models. The investigation of further enhancements of the presented algorithms as well as other promising approaches in the framework of surrogate-based optimization will be highly valuable.},

We investigate the problem to reveal a weak stochastic background signal which is covered by a strong foreground of compact-binary coalescences. The foreground, which is estimated by matched filters, has to be subtracted from the data. Even an optimal analysis of foreground signals will leave subtraction noise due to estimation errors of template parameters which may corrupt the measurement of the background signal. The subtraction noise can be removed by a noise projection. We apply our analysis pipeline to the proposed future-generation space-borne Big Bang Observer mission which seeks for a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves in the frequency range ∼0.1 Hz-1 Hz covered by a foreground of black-hole and neutron-star binaries. Our analysis is based on a simulation code which provides a dynamical model of a time-delay interferometer network. It generates the data as time series and incorporates the analysis pipeline together with the noise projection. Our results confirm previous ad hoc predictions which say that the Big Bang Observer will be sensitive to backgrounds with fractional energy densities below Ω=1E-16.},
